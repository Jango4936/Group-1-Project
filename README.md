# Group-1-Project


Small clinics, dentists, salons, and barbers still take bookings by phone or on paper. This causes double-bookings, no-shows, and wasted time. Customers also want to book any time on their phones. We aim to give these shops a low-cost website where clients can pick a slot, get reminders, and owners can see all bookings in one place. 

EasyBook is a webapp booking platform that lets small clinics, salons, barbers, and similar shops accept appointments 24 / 7.  
Clients book in seconds; owners manage an interactive calendar and get no-show-reducing reminders.
