# Group-1-Project


Small clinics, dentists, salons, and barbers still take bookings by phone or on paper. This causes double-bookings, no-shows, and wasted time. Customers also want to book any time on their phones. We aim to give these shops a low-cost website where clients can pick a slot, get reminders, and owners can see all bookings in one place. 


# Release Notes
- booking models was created
- initial setup of django files
